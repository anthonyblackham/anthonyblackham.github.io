The first opportunity I had to do some real GIS work was to work with the Utah Geological Survey on digitizing geologic maps. I worked with Zach Anderson in the Geologic Mapping group. This wasn't paid work but I did get some college credits for the project.

This was the publication I was working on and the final GIS data:

I generated an openlayers web map of my work:

<div class="embed-container">
  <iframe
      src="https://anthonyblackham.github.io/geologic-map/"
      width="700"
      height="480"
      frameborder="0"
      allowfullscreen="">
  </iframe>
</div>

I worked on a few projects with them and the following summer of 2015 I was able to do an internship at the Utah Geologic Survey under Marshall Robinson helping him convert the old HTML based website into a modern Wordpress content management system.

Marshall was great to work under and was patient with my lack of experience in web development. He helped me to figure things out on my own and in the end we came up with something to be proud of. Marshall has done a great job building and maintaining the UGS site, it's definitely one of if not the best geological survey website in the United States.
