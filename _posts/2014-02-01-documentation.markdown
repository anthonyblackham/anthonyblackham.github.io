Documentation is tedious to write but having the right tools and frameworks can make the experience a lot easier. 

Most of the documentation I've written has coincided with my project repositories on Github, so naturally I find myself writing notes in the Github wiki. Github has some options to improve the style of the wiki but sometimes it isn't quite enough. 

There are lots of different frameworks for documentation. Some examples include Sphinx, Jekyll, and MkDocs. Since Github wikis are markdown based I have found it simplest to integrate with MkDocs. The two MkDocs themes I prefer are:

- [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/)
- [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)

If you're using your Github wiki as a starting point for your documentation, there are a couple options when migrating to a different framework. You can continue to make your edits on the wiki and sync it to your framework or you can just migrate your wiki to its own repo and manage it through there with commits and pull requests. You can use also use them completely outside of Github as well but for the purpose of this guide we'll assume we are still going to be using github for editing and/or hosting our documentation.

Instead of going through the tedious installation and configuration process here, I've added them to both themes as an example for you to decide which would work better for your project.
