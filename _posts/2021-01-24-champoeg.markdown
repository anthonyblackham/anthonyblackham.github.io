I try to get out as much as I can and often find myself going down a rabbit hole revolving around the history of the places I go. 

Over the weekend something on the ground caught my eye. It looked like a piece of garbage but on a closer inspection turned out to be something more interesting. It was a piece of porcelain. 

Being a minimalist, the idea of having a china cabinet in my home is apalling and has never interested me in the slightest. However, finding some china in the middle of a field with seemingly nothing nearby piqued my interest. Come to find out I was standing on a town site that had washed away 160 years ago. 

Originally home to the Kalapuya Indians who were removed to the Grand Ronde reservation circa ~1856, Robert Newell platted the [town of Champoeg](https://secure.co.marion.or.us/weblink/DocView.aspx?id=4075848) (pronounced shampoo-EE) in 1853 though it may have been surveyed as early as 1844 by Jesse Applegate who surveyed [Oregon City](https://anthonyblackham.com/oregon-city-claim/) around the same time. 

Robert Newell's claim can also be seen on the 1852 [GLO plat](https://glorecords.blm.gov/details/patent/default.aspx?accession=OROCAA%20002787&docClass=SER)

Champoeg is central to Oregon's history in that it was the site of the first vote to form a provisional government on May 2, 1843. There is some [dispute](https://pamplinmedia.com/cr/28-opinion/322588-201736-oregon-perpetuates-myth-of-close-statehood-vote) on the number of voters. John McLoughlin while not present at the vote, recommended against forming a provisional government. In 1901 Francois X. Matthieu, the last surviving voter, located the original site of the meeting and the Oregon Historical Society placed an [obelisk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champoeg,_Oregon#/media/File:Champoeg_Monument.jpg) engraved with the names of those who voted yes to establish a provisional government. 

In 1861 the Willamette River flooded and washed away the town site. There were some meager attempts to rebuild but with the advent of the rail and subsequent floods it never fully recovered. 

In 1913 Champoeg was established as a "Provisional Government Park" and subsequently a state park in 1943. The visitor's center was built in 1977 on the site of Donald Manson's house. His barn, which had been built in 1862 using reclaimed timber from the flood, was restored in 1992.

There were at least 3 archaeological digs I know of but likely more:

[1973-1974](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gbaku/albums/72157600318881469) with John Atherton - Former archaeologist for Oregon State University

[2002 or earlier?](https://www.archaeologychannel.org/video-guide-summary/138-uncovering-a-past-champoeg-park) David Brauner - Former archaeologist for Oregon State University

[2013-2014](https://traveloregon.com/things-to-do/culture-history/historic-sites-oregon-trail/digging-oregons-history/) also David Brauner

Now that we've delved into the local history, let's plot the location of where I found the porcelain and see how it comes together. The left side is imagery from 2014 and the right side is imagery from 2019 - you can slide it back and forth to compare the dig site before and after it was buried.

The proximity to the most recent archaeological dig and the help of the local molepeople bringing the porcelain to the surface are convincing evidence of correlation. For further evidence there is a [thesis](https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/graduate_thesis_or_dissertations/7h149t836?locale=en) in 1986 by Lou Ann Speulda Nichols (again under Mr. Brauner) detailing some of the porcelain found. Also another in 2019 again under Brauner by [Cayla Hill](https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/graduate_thesis_or_dissertations/8049gb614?locale=en) showing some similar artifacts.

Harriet Munnick who was also a party shown in the 1973 dig happens to have [written a book](https://books.google.com/books/about/French_Prairie_Ceramics.html?id=aHUvp6nmrk4C) all about transfer printed earthenwares in the French Prairie. Some of her collection can be viewed online at the [St. Paul Mission Historical Society](https://spmhs.pastperfectonline.com/webobject)

I left it in place and [notified the state park rangers](https://www.oregon.gov/oprd/OH/pages/archaeology.aspx) to contact the appropriate people to collect it. Maybe they have the rest of the plate in OSU's collections and it's missing the exact piece I found and they can carefully slide it in like the last piece of a puzzle. 

What started out as a weekend walk turned into an interesting trip deeper into Oregon's history. I'm sure it won't be the last. For the record, I still have no interest in owning a china cabinet - it belongs in a museum.
